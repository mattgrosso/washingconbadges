This was written by Matt Grosso because he runs WashingCon.

Future Matt, in a year you're going to want to work on this some more. Here's how you get started:

In the root directory just run 'gulp watch' and gulp will compile and start up everything you need including SASS and Browser Sync.

To deploy you can run 'npm deploy' which will put the site online using 'Surge' at [https://washingcon.surge.sh](https://washingcon.surge.sh)
